# Mapping_Earthquakes

This Challenge was to identify earthquakes globally over the past seven days, then add tectonic plate data as an overlay for the magnitudes of earthquakes and then identify earthquakes of larger magnitudes.  Subsequently, this data was added to a map created with different map styles. 

Firstly, a map structure was created, then the tectonic data was called by using d3json. Thereafter, GeoJSON was used to add a data layer. The tectonic lines are then highlighted. The larger magnitude of earthquakes labelled “major earthquakes” are also made visible with bigger sized circles and different colors. 

These changes are displayed after opening the index.html file in the web browser.  The other map styles utilized in this challenge were different colors and sizes relative to the magnitudes of earthquakes and a legend which displays the different color coding for the different types of magnitudes.
